A simple tic-tac-toe game


This is a simple tic-tac-toe game I created over the weekend in order to break up the monotony of dissertation writing.

The present version allows you to play human vs. computer.  You may choose who goes first.  The first player is always 'X'.

If I ever get inspired to pick this back up, a future version would also have a human vs. human option.  I would also like to beef up the AI a bit.

Enjoy!
